## Test Matrix

- [ ] Re-enable CI execution for .NET 10 once integration test runtime stabilises. _(Temporarily disabled in CI until a stable SDK lands; current runs target net8.0 only.)_
- [ ] Extend the publish pipeline so the global tool ships a net10.0 asset once the hosted runners expose a compatible SDK or we provide it explicitly.
