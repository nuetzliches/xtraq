title: What is xtraq?
description: xtraq is a .NET CLI that turns SQL Server stored procedures into strongly typed C# artefacts.Instead of hand-writing ADO.NET plumbing or scattering SQL strings throughout your application, the generator produces request models, result types, and execution helpers that stay aligned with the database schema.
---

## Key Capabilities

- Generates strongly typed inputs and result models for every stored procedure in a snapshot.
- Emits async execution helpers that wrap SqlCommand setup, parameter ordering, and nullability checks.
- Supports table-valued parameters, user-defined types, and nested JSON payloads without losing type safety.
- Targets both .NET 8.0 and .NET 10.0 so you can adopt the latest runtime while keeping compatibility.
- Works in CI/CD: the same commands used locally (`snapshot`, `build`, `update`) run deterministically in pipelines.

## How the Workflow Fits Together

1. **Install the CLI** with `dotnet tool install --global xtraq` (or update via `dotnet tool update -g xtraq`).
2. **Initialize configuration** using `xtraq init`. This writes a tracked `.xtraqconfig` for non-sensitive defaults and ensures a project-scoped `.env` exists for secrets such as `XTRAQ_GENERATOR_DB`.
3. **Capture a snapshot** with `xtraq snapshot`. The command crawls stored procedures, parameters, and result-set shapes, then stores the metadata under `.xtraq/snapshots`.
4. **Generate code** by running `xtraq build`. Artefacts land in the `Xtraq/` directory by default, ready to commit or publish as a NuGet package.

Whenever procedures change on the server, re-running `snapshot` followed by `build` keeps the generated code current. The generator diffing logic highlights signature changes early, so breaking schema edits do not surprise application teams.

## Who Benefits?

- **Database administrators** retain control over security boundaries. Stored procedures stay authoritative, and the generated client layer faithfully enforces parameter contracts.
- **Application developers** gain strongly typed models that respect nullable annotations, JSON payloads, and table-valued parameters—all without writing manual mapping code.
- **Operations and CI teams** integrate xtraq into pipelines to validate schema drift, regenerate packages, or publish client libraries automatically.
