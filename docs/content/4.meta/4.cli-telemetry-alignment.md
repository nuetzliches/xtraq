title: CLI Telemetry Alignment
description: Tracking the rollout of Xtraq's DOTNET CLI telemetry compliance.

## Status · 2025-11-18

- Stage 1 implements a local hashed usage channel that writes `.xtraq/telemetry/cli-usage.jsonl` per invocation.
- Opt-out now honours `DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`, `XTRAQ_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`, and `XTRAQ_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`, and telemetry is skipped automatically when common CI indicators are present.
- A first-run disclosure banner mirrors the .NET CLI wording and records consent state in `.xtraq/telemetry/cli-telemetry-consent.json`.

## Next Steps

1. Decide whether anonymised aggregates should be uploaded or remain local-only, including retention and publishing policy.
2. Backfill automated tests around consent persistence, CI detection, and opt-out parsing.
3. Publish a schema reference for the CLI telemetry payload once ingestion decisions are finalised.
