title: Quickstart
description: From zero to first generated code in minutes. Follow these steps to install the xtraq CLI, initialize configuration, and generate your first client code.
---

## Prerequisites

- .NET 10 SDK on the PATH — the CLI defaults to net10.0; keep the .NET 8 SDK installed only if you must build for the LTS runtime.
- Network access to the SQL Server instance that hosts your stored procedures

## 1. Prepare Your Environment

Make sure the xtraq CLI is available on your machine. Follow the [Installation guide](./installation.md) if you have not installed (or recently updated) the tool.

## 2. Initialize Configuration

```bash
xtraq init --connection "Server=.;Database=AppDb;Trusted_Connection=True;"
```

This command creates (or updates) the tracked `.xtraqconfig` that carries non-sensitive defaults (namespace, output directory, schema allow-list). Secrets such as `XTRAQ_GENERATOR_DB` stay in a project-scoped `.env` or your preferred secrets store. When you need workstation-specific overrides, mirror any entries in `.xtraqconfig.local`—it uses the same schema but is ignored by Git. Re-running `xtraq init` safely updates only the keys you specify.

## 3. Capture a Snapshot

```bash
xtraq snapshot
```

`xtraq snapshot` captures the latest stored procedure metadata and writes it to `.xtraq/snapshots` using the connection string resolved from environment variables or `.env`. Non-sensitive defaults travel with the repository through `.xtraqconfig`, so teammates only need to supply their local secrets.

## 4. Generate Code

```bash
xtraq build
```

Generated files land in the `Xtraq/` directory by default. Override the location by setting `XTRAQ_OUTPUT_DIR` in `.xtraqconfig` or by passing `--output` on the command line.

## Next Steps

- Review and commit the contents of the `Xtraq/` directory.
- Review tracked defaults and optional secrets in [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration-schema.md).
- Explore additional commands in the [CLI Reference](../cli/index.md).
